# Introduction
We present aircraft measurments over West Arica
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004)
Jones et al conducted several studies but continental scale measurements have not changed significantly

#Motivation
Find out more about thsi important phenomenon.

#Simulatiomns
We simulate the evolution of a particle

#Methodology 

We compared our measurements of particle aging with a mono-simulation. The model is details in Smith et al (2006).

#Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth
